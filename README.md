# Summary
This is Hellebore Simulator, a space combat simulator I'm making to see if the Hellebore magnetic accelerator 
cannon from [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/) series of webnovels makes any sense at all.
Specifically, I want to be able to simulate special relativity to see if a projectile fired at high fractions of the speed of light
and the ability to change its trajectory to guide itself to the target could reliably hit or get within a few thousand kilometers of a target
going at low fractions of the speed of light and with a randomly changing trajectory from ~100 million kilometers like the webnovel says it can.

Making this repo at this unfinished stage so I can work on my laptop and my desktop.

# To Do
 * simulate newtonian mechanics <- I am here
 * make a framework for agents to take actions using their assigned ships.
 * simulate special relativity excluding time dilation and light lag per frame of reference
 * simulate time dilation and light lag per frame of reference
 * make preprogrammed agents for the Hellebore and the chasing ship
